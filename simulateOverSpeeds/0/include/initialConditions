// Mesh non-orthogonality is 61. That is pretty good

// 0.24 (starting value) gives 0.0124. Actually 0.293. Rasaero says 0.18. From my brief research, this could indicate that our tKE should be lower to match Rasaero, though I doubt it.
// With a higher accuracy mesh, I got 0.255283
// I'm thinking that a really good mesh and some alterations to fvSchemes could get me to success
// with Gauss linearUpwindV cellMDLimited Gauss linear 1, I got 0.24373
// With increased surface layers, I got 0.231088
// With some unbounded it converged at about the same rate to 0.230934

// With slightly different fvSchemes, I got 0.242


// kEpsilon exploded, so I think I am going to stick with the kOmegaSST for now and just focus on the other stuff. That might be dumb, but I need to do more researc on the different turbulence sims anyways.


// It is interesting that everything decreases the CD
// 0.75 gives 0.0125 (I think that the residuals are slightly lower)
// 2.5 gives 0.0126 with same residuals
// 25 gives 0.138 with low residuals
